Feedback on the first assignment
The program looks good. You seem to have a handle on how to code in MATLAB and python. When turning in assignments, make sure that your program is self-contained - meaning that any directory reference in relative to your position in the repository and not your specific computer.
Also, I think you misunderstood the differences between higher-order methods and higher-order derivatives. Your programs are all taking the first derivative, but just use higher order (more precise) methods. The table in the slides are only addressing the first derivative calculation.
